Welcome to my narcissistic corner on the Net.

I am a computer scientist working on the design and implementation of large-scale distributed systems, including, but not limited to, P2P systems, Network Protocols, and Agreement Problems.
I enjoy reasoning about concurrency in large-scale systems and the challenges it brings to achieving consistency.

I currently work for [Weilliptic Inc.](https://weilliptic.ai), a startup building the above-the-clouds OS layer for AI applications.

Previously, I have worked as a Research Engineer at [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems) on the formal specification and verification of distributed protocols.
Before that, I have worked on the Hedvig Distributed Storage system, a multi-interface, software-defined, elastic storage system, at Hedvig Inc.
Once Hedvig was acquired by [Commvault](https://www.commvault.com/), HDS became the Commvault Distributed Storage System, which I helped evolve into the underlying piece of the Commvault data management offer.

Before that, I have also worked for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a Software Development Engineer, where I wrote code that runs in the MS identity-related cloud and in the most deployed directory service in the world.

On the academic front, I was a member of the [Computer Science Faculty](https://www.facom.ufu.br) @ [Federal University of Uberlândia](https://www.ufu.br), focused on distributed computing.

I received my PhD from [IC/Unicamp](https://www.ic.unicamp.br), Brazil, and [USI](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en), Switzerland, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Edmundo Madeira](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~edmundo) and Prof. [Fernando Pedone](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/pedone/).

Welcome to my narcissistic corner on the Net.

I am a computer scientist working on the design and implementation of large scale distributed systems including, but not limited to, P2P systems, Network Protocols, and Agreement Problems.
I enjoy reasoning about concurrency in large scale systems and the challenges it brings to achieving consistency.

I currently work at a [Stealth]() startup and will add more details soon. 

Previously I have worked as a Research Engineer at [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems) on the formal specification and verification of distributed protocols.
Before that I have worked on the Hedvig Distributed Storage system, a multi interface, software defined, elastic storage system, at Hedvig Inc.
Once Hedvig was acquired by [Commvault](https://www.commvault.com/), HDS became the Commvault Distributed Storage System, which I helped evolve so it could become the underlying piece of the Commvault data management offer.

Before that I have also worked for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a Software Development Engineer, where I wrote code that runs in the MS identity related cloud and in the most deployed directory service in the world.

On the academic front I was part of the [Computer Science Faculty](https://www.facom.ufu.br) @ [Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia](https://www.ufu.br), where I researched, taught and advised in the area of distributed systems. I was also part of the Computer Science graduate school, where I advised a number of MSc Students.

I received my PhD from [IC/Unicamp](https://www.ic.unicamp.br), Brazil, and [USI](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en), Switzerland, where I worked under the supervision of Profs. [Edmundo Madeira](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~edmundo) and [Fernando Pedone](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/pedone/). 
<!-- As a PhD student I was a member of the Sprint project on high performance database replication.-->

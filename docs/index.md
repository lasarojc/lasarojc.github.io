Welcome to my narcissistic corner on the Net.

I am a computer scientist working on the design and implementation of large scale distributed systems including, but not limited to, P2P systems, Network Protocols, and Agreement Problems.
I enjoy reasoning about concurrency in large scale systems and the challenges it brings to achieving consistency.

As part of the former Hedvig Inc. team and now at [Commvault](https://www.commvault.com/), I help in developing and evolving the Commvault Distributed Storage System, which underlies the Commvault data management offer.

Previously I have also worked for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a Software Development Engineer on the Active Directory and BPOS, where I wrote code that runs in the MS identity related cloud and in the most deployed directory service in the world.

On the academic front I was part of the [Computer Science Faculty](https://www.facom.ufu.br) @ [Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia](https://www.ufu.br), where I researched, taught and advised in the area of distributed systems. I still colaborate with the Computer Science graduate school. 

I received my PhD from [IC/Unicamp](https://www.ic.unicamp.br), Brazil, and [USI](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en), Switzerland, where I worked under the supervision of Profs. [Edmundo Madeira](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~edmundo) and [Fernando Pedone](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/pedone/). 
<!-- As a PhD student I was a member of the Sprint project on high performance database replication.-->

Welcome to my narcissistic corner on the Net.

As part of the former Hedvig Inc. team and now at [Commvault](https://www.commvault.com/), I help develop and evolve the Commvault Distributed Storage System, which underlies the whole Commvault data management. 

As part of the [Computer Science Faculty](https://www.facom.ufu.br) @ [Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia](https://www.ufu.br), I research, teach and advise in the area of distributed systems. 

Previously I have also worked for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a Software Development Engineer on the Active Directory and BPOS, where I wrote code that runs in the MS identity related cloud and in the most deployed directory service in the world.

I received my PhD from [IC/Unicamp](https://www.ic.unicamp.br), Brazil, and [USI](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en), Switzerland, where I worked under the supervision of Profs. [Edmundo Madeira](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~edmundo) and [Fernando Pedone](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/pedone/). 
As a PhD student I was a member of the Sprint project on high performance database replication.

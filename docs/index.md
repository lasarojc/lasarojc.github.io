Welcome to my narcissistic corner on the Net.

I work as Principal Engineer for [Hedvig, a Commvault Venture]i(https://www.commvault.com/resources/hedvig-distributed-storage-platform), and as an Associate Professor for the [Computer Science Faculty](www.facom.ufu.br) @ [Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia](www.ufu.br), where I co-founded the [Distributed Systems and Networks research group](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedsystemsandnetworks/members).

Previously I have also worked for [Microsoft](www.microsoft.com) as a Software Development Engineer on the Active Directory and BPOS, where I wrote code that run in the MS identity related cloud and in the most deployed directory service in the world.

I received my PhD from [IC/Unicamp](www.ic.unicamp.br), Brazil, and [USI](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en) Switzerland, where I worked under the supervision of Profs. [Edmundo Madeira](www.ic.unicamp.br/~edmundo) and [Fernando Pedone](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/pedone/). As a PhD student I was a member of the Sprint project on high performance database replication.

In general, I like working on interesting problems and so far I've found plenty of them in distributed computing.

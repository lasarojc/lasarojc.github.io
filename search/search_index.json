Date of patent: May 9, 2023       United States Patent and Trademark Office.    </p> Abstract <p>In a running distributed data storage system that actively processes I/Os, metadata nodes are commissioned and decommissioned without taking down the storage system and without introducing interruptions to metadata or payload data I/O. The inflow of reads and writes continues without interruption even while new metadata nodes are in the process of being added and/or removed, and the strong consistency of the system is guaranteed. Commissioning and decommissioning nodes within the running system enables streamlined replacement of permanently failed nodes and advantageously enables the system to adapt elastically to workload changes. An illustrative distributed barrier logic (the \u201cview change barrier\u201d) controls a multi-state process that controls a coordinated step-wise progression of the metadata nodes from an old view to a new normal. Rules for I/O handling govern each state until the state machine loop has been traversed and the system reaches its new normal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Container Data mover for Migrating Data Between Distributed Data Storage Systems Integrated with Application Orchestrators      Srividhya Kavaipatti Anantharamakrishnan, L\u00e1saro Camargos, Abhijith Shenoy, Xiangyu Wang, Avinash Lakshman, Srinivas Lakshman        Patent Number: US 11.314.687 B2.

United States Patent and Trademark Office.    </p> Abstract <p>A distributed data storage system comprises features for integration with application orchestrators such as Kubernetes and includes a proprietary Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver. Features include setting snapshot scheduling and retention policies, and a \u201ccontainer data mover\u201d that replicates data from a source to a distinct destination distributed data storage system. The migration may be configured one-to-one, one-to-many, unidirectional, and/or bidirectional. Metadata-based snapshots and metadata-based changed block tracking identify payload data to move from source to destination within application orchestrator frameworks at both ends. Payload data is migrated from source to destination using different techniques than those used for migrating metadata, e.g., kernel-to-kernel for copying payload data versus ordinary metadata writes. An illustrative barrier logic ensures that the migration follows a controlled progression of operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Synchronization of Metadata in a Distributed Storage System      Avinash Lakshman, Lasaro Camargos, and Deepak Jain               Patent Number: US 10.740.300 B1.    Date of Patent: August 12, 2020.       United States Patent and Trademark Office.    </p> Abstract <p>A client machine writes to and reads from a virtual disk on a remote storage platform. Metadata is generated and stored in replicas on different metadata nodes of the storage platform. A modified log-structured merge tree is used to store and compact string-sorted tables of metadata. During file storage and compaction, a consistent file identification scheme is used across all metadata nodes. A fingerprint file is calculated for each SST (metadata) file on disk that includes hash values corresponding to regions of the SST file. To synchronize, the fingerprint files of two SST files are compared, and if any hash values are missing from a fingerprint file, then the key-value-timestamp triples corresponding to these missing hash values are sent to the SST file that is missing them. The SST file is compacted with the missing triples to create a new version of the SST file. The synchronization is bi-directional.</p> </li> <li> <p>Anti-entropy-based metadata recovery in a strongly consistent distributed data storage system      Deepak Jain, L\u00e1saro Camargos, Srinivas Lakshman, Avinash Lakshman       Patent Number: 11.789.830 Date of Patent: October 17, 2023       United States Patent and Trademark Office.    </p> Abstract <p>A strongly consistent distributed data storage system comprises an enhanced metadata service that is capable of fully recovering all metadata that goes missing when a metadata-carrying disk, disks, and/or partition fails. An illustrative recovery service runs automatically or on demand to bring the metadata node back into full service. Advantages of the recovery service include guaranteed full recovery of all missing metadata, including metadata still residing in commit logs, without impacting strong consistency guarantees of the metadata. The recovery service is network-traffic efficient. In preferred embodiments, the recovery service avoids metadata service downtime at the metadata node, thereby reducing the impact of metadata disk failure on the availability of the system. The disclosed metadata recovery techniques are said to be \u201cself-healing\u201d as they do not need manual intervention and instead automatically detect failures and automatically recover from the failures in a non-disruptive manner.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"publications/#journals","title":"Journals","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Generic Multicast: One Group Communication Primitive to Rule Them All     Bolina, J., Rocha, D. A., Camargos, L., &amp; Sutra, P.      Journal of Internet Services and Applications (12 April 2025)   Access Access</p> Abstract <p>Group communication primitives have a central role in modern computing infrastructures. They offer a panel of reliability and ordering guarantees for messages, enabling the implementation of complex distributed interactions. In particular, atomic broadcast is a pivotal abstraction for implementing fault-tolerant distributed services. This primitive allows disseminating messages across the system in a total order. There are two group communication primitives closely related to atomic broadcast. Atomic multicast permits targeting a subset of participants, possibly stricter than the whole system. Generic broadcast leverages the semantics of messages to order them only where necessary, that is, when they do not commute at the application level (a conflict). In this paper, we propose to combine all these primitives into a single, more general one, called generic multicast. We formally specify the guarantees offered by generic multicast and present efficient algorithms. Compared to prior works, our solutions offer appealing properties in terms of time and space complexity. In particular, when a run is conflict-free, that is, no two messages conflict, a message is delivered after at most three message delays. We explain the logic of our algorithms, detail their main invariants, and prove them correct. We also present a variation that delivers messages across the system in an order consistent with real-time at the cost of a message delay. This variation is particularly interesting to implement partially-replicated data storage systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Model Update for Intrusion Detection: Analyzing the Performance of Delayed Labeling and Active Learning Strategies     Gilberto Ol\u00edmpio Jr., Lasaro Camargos, Rodrigo Sanches Miani, Elaine Ribeiro Faria      Computers &amp; Security (November 2023)   Access</p> Abstract <p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) help protect computer networks by identifying and detecting attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data via computer networks by inspecting packets separately or in the context of flows. Intrusion detection is a classification task performed on continuously generated packets with a non-stationary distribution (data stream). As such, the decision models used for Intrusion Detection must be constantly updated to account for changes in what constitutes normal traffic of a network and correctly identify attacks. This work evaluates two approaches concerning label availability to update the intrusion detection classifier. First, we analyze the impact of delayed labeling of samples on the classifiers' performance, and second, we evaluate the impact of using active learning strategies on the classifiers. Our experimental evaluation uses two datasets (CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018) to compare different data stream classification algorithms under different evaluation measures. Based on comparison results, we studied different active learning techniques to estimate the impact of delayed labeling on packet-based IDS. We found that the performance of the classifiers is inversely proportional to the label delivery rate. Besides, the active learning strategies helped keep the performance compatible with the baselines, even with a small set of labeled instances.</p> </li> <li> <p>Analysis of Monitoring and Multipath Support on top of OpenFlow Specification      Pedro Rezende, Paulo R. S. L. Coelho, Luiz F. Faina, Lasaro Camargos, Rafael Pasquini     International Journal of Network Management (5 January 2018)  Access </p> Abstract <p>In general, traffic is pushed through a single path despite the existence of alternative paths in networks. For example, routing solutions based on spanning trees prune the topology to prevent loops, consequently preventing the use of alternative paths. Research on quality of service frequently advocates that the use of alternative paths is interesting for enforcing Service Level Agreements (SLAs), bypassing bottlenecks created by shortest paths. In this paper, we are interested in analyzing the support for monitoring network traffic and for provisioning of multi paths in software\u2010defined networking (SDN), given the strong platform it provides for the experimentation of new networked solutions. Our approach firstly enriches the topology view at the control plane with data gathered through fine-grain data plane monitoring. On the basis of such an enriched view, our system determines the path, or multipath, necessary to enforce the specified SLA. We propose 2 extension modules to an OpenFlow controller: SDNMon, which monitors the data plane to enrich the topology information at the control plane, and MP\u2010Routing, which determines a set of paths, in the absence of a single path capable of enforcing the SLA. Both modules are extensively evaluated, and the results not only demonstrate what can be achieved in terms of accuracy in SDNMon and in terms of quality of service benefits in MP\u2010Routing but also highlight some limitations of the OpenFlow specification. On the basis of our findings, we propose a set of new counters to Per Port and Per Flow granularity levels of the OpenFlow specification.</p> </li> <li> <p>A game theoretical approach to model the channel selection dynamics in non-coordinated IEEE 802.11 networks      S\u00e9rgio L.

These uncoordinated access networks aim to improve their operation by choosing the best wireless channel available, characterizing competition over the restricted set of possible channels. This work analyses this competition using Game Theory and Markov Chains models, showing that such competitive behavior can lead to Nash Equilibria and that outcomes will not be maximal. Additionally, partially and fully cooperative models are proposed and evaluated, allowing (a) individual players to increase global results using arbitrarily computed and non-rational moves, and (b) achieving maximal outcomes when considering the cooperation of up to all players.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multicoordinated agreement for groups of agents      Lasaro Camargos, Rodrigo Schmidt, Edmundo R. M. Madeira, Fernando Pedone        Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society (23 April 2010)  PDF </p> Abstract <p>Agents in agreement protocols play distinct roles. Proposers propose values to the acceptors, which will accept proposals and inform the learners so they detect that an agreement has been reached. A fourth role is that of the coordinator, who filters the proposals from proposers to acceptors. While proposers, learners, and coordinators are easily replaced, substituting an acceptor is prohibitive. Protocols that do not employ a coordinator are less resilient to acceptor failures. Protocols that use one coordinator are more resilient to acceptor failures, at the expense of one extra communication step even in the absence of failures. Moreover, they require replacing the coordinator as soon as it fails, a reconfiguration that, although relatively inexpensive, diminishes the protocol availability. Hence, either option, i.e., one or zero coordinator, has its drawbacks. In previous works, we have presented an alternative: multicoordinated agreement protocols. Such protocols are as resilient as single-coordinated protocols but require less reconfiguration to cope with coordinator failures. In fact, most reconfiguration can be done in parallel to the execution of the protocol's normal steps. Multicoordination can be applied to several problems. In this paper, we exemplify its use in solving consensus and then introduce a fast multicoordinated agreement protocol for agents organized in groups, an abstraction for fast local area networks interconnected by slower links.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"publications/#book-chapters","title":"Book Chapters","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Byzantine Collision-Fast Consensus Protocols      Rodrigo Saramago, Eduardo Alchieri, Tuanir Rezende, Lasaro Camargos     Transactions on Computational Collective Intelligence XXXIII  PDF </p> Abstract <p>Atomic broadcast protocols are fundamental building blocks used in the construction of many reliable distributed systems. Atomic broadcast and consensus are equivalent problems, but the inefficiency of consensus-based atomic broadcast protocols in the presence of collisions (concurrent proposals) harms their adoption in the implementation of reliable systems, such as the ones based on state machine replication. In the traditional consensus protocols, proposals that are not decided in some instance of consensus (commands not delivered) must be re-proposed in a new instance, delaying their execution. Moreover, whether different values (commands) are proposed in the same instance (leading to a collision), some of its phases must be restarted, also delaying the execution of these commands involved in the collision.

We determined that inspecting packets individually renders similar performance to examining flows in several situations and that only a subset of the packets\u2019 headers is sufficient for the classification.

We envision that GPaxos may unify within a single and novel Agreement-as-a-Service infrastructure with multiple distributed protocols. To date, this potential is however not been fully unleashed, due to the steep learning curve of the protocol and the high complexity of its implementation. Moreover, before GPaxos reaches real-world usage, several computationally expensive operations have to be optimized and simplified. This paper aims to close this gap between theory and practice. To this end, we first provide a concise tour of Generalized Paxos, hardly found elsewhere. Then, we assess the versatility of the Generalized Consensus problem by presenting a variation of GPaxos that solves the lease coordination problem. Our last contribution consists of three optimizations that apply to the critical phases of the algorithm: i) a method to quickly start a new round, ii) a novel approach to execute a checkpoint, and iii) a data structure that speeds up the detection of an agreement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Priority-Based State Machine Replication with PRaxos      Paulo R. Pinho Filho, Luciana De Oliveira Rech, Lau Cheuk Lung, Miguel Correia, L\u00e1saro Camargos      2016 IEEE 30<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)   PDF </p> Abstract <p>State machine replication is a form of active replication commonly used to create fault-tolerant distributed services. In a nutshell, the approach consists of ensuring that a set of replicas receive and execute the same sequence of deterministic requests, returning the same results. This approach handles all requests evenly, but for some services, it is important to consider that some requests have priority over others, i.e., that whenever two or more requests are ready to be executed, the one with higher priority is executed first. Paxos is perhaps the best-known protocol to order requests in asynchronous environments, but Paxos has no notion of priority. In this paper, we introduce the notion of priority-based state machine replication and modify Paxos to take request priorities into account. The proposed algorithm, PRaxos, works in three steps and satisfies Paxos' safety properties in asynchronous systems while enforcing priorities when the system behaves synchronously. </p> </li> <li> <p>An Architecture for Monitoring and Improving Public Transportation Systems      Pedro H.

For  high  availability  purposes, logically  centralized  SDN  controllers  follow  a  distributed  implementation.  While  controller  role  features  in  the  OpenFlow protocol allow switches to communicate with multiple controllers, these mechanisms alone are not sufficient to guarantee a resilient control plane,  leaving  the  actual  implementation an  open  challenge for SDN designers. This paper explores OpenFlow roles for the  design  of  resilient  SDN  control  plane  and  proposes  AR2C2as  an  actively  replicated  multi-controller  strategy.  As  proof  of concept,  AR2C2  is  implemented  based  on  the  Ryu  controller and  relying  on  OpenReplica  to  ensure  a consistent  state  among the   distributed   controllers.

Neste artigo propomos contornar tal limita\u00e7\u00e3o estendendo o Cassandra com suporte a buscas por dados similares. Nossa abordagem usa hashing sens\u00ed-vel \u00e0 localidade para distribuir dados entre n\u00f3s, direcionar buscas, e recuperar dados em armazenamento est\u00e1vel de forma eficiente. Descrevemos aqui como implementar esta abordagem, nosso plano de testes e resultados iniciais. Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o Cassandra [Lakshman and Malik 2010] \u00e9 um banco de dados NOSQL (Not Only SQL) amplamente utilizado em cen\u00e1rios BigData devido \u00e0 sua escalabilidade horizontal. Como em outros NOSQL [Decandia et al. 2007, Chang et al. 2008], essa caracter\u00edstica vem do consistent hashing, particionamento aleat\u00f3rio dos dados entre os n\u00f3s do sistema que dis-tribui a carga uniformemente entre os mesmos e facilita sua entrada e sa\u00edda do sistema [Stoica et al. 2001]. Apesar das vantagens, essa distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dificulta a busca por dados similares, outra caracter\u00edstica desej\u00e1vel em BigData. Dois objetos de um mesmo dom\u00ednio s\u00e3o similares se seus atributos possuem um grau de semelhan\u00e7a elevado; caso contr\u00e1rio s\u00e3o dissimilares. A busca por similaridade consiste em recuperar objetos que sejam similares aos par\u00e2metros da consulta. Alguns exemplos incluem a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de perfis de clientes com h\u00e1bitos de consumo parecidos e de imagens com o mesmo tema. Dentre alguns esfor\u00e7os para se melhorar a busca por similaridade nestes sistemas, destacamos a HammingDHT [Villaca et al. 2013]. Na HammingDHT, a chave de cada objeto \u00e9 constru\u00edda por uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o de espa-lhamento sens\u00edvel a localidade (LSH), que gera chaves similares para dados similares e ???++ \" Agradecimentos \u00e0 CAPES, CNPq, FAPEMIG e FAPES pelo apoio \u00e0 realiza\u00e7\u00e3o deste trabalho.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"publications/#peer-reviewed-workshop","title":"Peer-reviewed Workshop","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Comutador P4 com Suporte a Roteamento Multicaminhos      Lucas Borges Fernandes, Pedro Henrique Ribeiro, Leonardo Martins, Rafael Pasquini, Luis F.

They appear when the components of the system must concur on reconfigurations, changes of state, or in lines of action in general. Examples of agreement problems are Consensus, Atomic Commitment, and Atomic Broadcast. In this thesis we investigate these abstractions in the context of the environment in which they will run and the applications that they will serve; in general, we consider the asynchronous crash-recovery model. The goal is to devise protocols that explore the contextual information to deliver improved availability. The correctness of our protocols holds even when the extra assumptions do not. In the first part of this thesis, we explore the following property: messages broadcast in small networks tend to be delivered in order and reliably. We make three contributions in this part. The first contribution is to turn known Consensus algorithms that harness this ordering property to reach agreement in the crash-stop model into practical protocols. That is, protocols that tolerate message losses and recovery after crashes, efficiently. Our protocols ensure progress even in the presence of failures if spontaneous ordering holds frequently. In the absence of spontaneous ordering, some other assumption is required to cope with failures. The second contribution of this thesis is to generalize one of our crash-recovery consensus protocols as a ``multicoordinated'' mode of a hybrid Consensus protocol, that may use spontaneous ordering or failure detection to progress. Compared to other protocols, ours provides improved availability with no price in resilience. The third contribution is to employ this new mode to solve Generalized Consensus, a problem that generalizes a series of other agreement problems and, hence, is of much practical interest. Moreover, we considered several aspects of solving this problem in practice, which had not been considered before. As a result, our Generalized Consensus protocol features graceful degradation, load balancing, and is parsimonious in accessing stable storage. In the second part of this thesis, we have considered agreement problems in wide-area networks organized hierarchically. More specifically, we considered a topology that is commonplace in the data centers of large corporations: groups of nodes, with large-bandwidth low-latency links connecting the nodes in the same group, and slow and limited links connecting nodes in different groups. In such environments, latency is clearly a major concern, and reconfiguration procedures that render the agreement protocol momentarily unavailable must be avoided as much as possible. Our contribution here is to avoid reconfigurations and improve the availability of a collision-fast agreement protocol. That is a protocol that can reach agreement in two intergroup communication steps, irrespectively to concurrent proposals. Besides the use of a multicoordinated approach, we employed multicast primitives and consensus to restrict some reconfigurations to within groups, where they are less expensive. In the last part of this thesis, we study the problem of terminating distributed transactions. The problem consists of enforcing agreement among the parties on whether to commit or roll back the transaction and ensuring the durability of committed transactions. Our contribution to this topic is an abstract log service that detaches the termination problem from the processes actually performing the transactions. The service works as a black box and abstracts its implementation details from the application utilizing it. Moreover, it allows slow and failed resource managers to be restarted on different hosts without relying on the stable storage of the previous host. We provide two implementations of the service, which we evaluated experimentally.</p> </li> <li> <p>MSc Thesis - DisCusS desenvolvendo um Servi\u00e7o de Consenso gen\u00e9rico, simples e modular      Lasaro Camargos      State university of Campinas  PDF </p> Abstract <p>Esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o trata do processo de engenharia de um servi\u00e7o de detec\u00e7\u00e3o de falhas compat\u00edvel com FT-CORBA, a especifica\u00e7\u00e3o para toler\u00e2ncia a falhas em CORBA, e de um servi\u00e7co de consenso distribu\u00eddo.

Veja a seguinte vers\u00e3o, que contem partes que obviamente deixaram de ser v\u00e1lidas e outras que nem precisariam ser ditas.</p> <p>Juramento de Hip\u00f3crates</p> <p>Eu juro, por Apolo, m\u00e9dico, por Escul\u00e1pio, Higeia e Panaceia, e tomo por testemunhas todos os deuses e todas as deusas, cumprir, segundo meu poder e minha raz\u00e3o, a promessa que se segue:</p> <p>Estimar, tanto quanto a meus pais, aquele que me ensinou esta arte; fazer vida comum e, se necess\u00e1rio for, com ele partilhar meus bens;    </p> <p>Ter seus filhos por meus pr\u00f3prios irm\u00e3os; ensinar-lhes esta arte, se eles tiverem necessidade de aprend\u00ea-la, sem remunera\u00e7\u00e3o e nem compromisso escrito; fazer participar dos preceitos, das li\u00e7\u00f5es e de todo o resto do ensino, meus filhos, os de meu mestre e os disc\u00edpulos inscritos segundo os regulamentos da profiss\u00e3o, por\u00e9m, s\u00f3 a estes.    </p> <p>Aplicarei os regimes para o bem do doente segundo o meu poder e entendimento, nunca para causar dano ou mal a algu\u00e9m. A ningu\u00e9m darei por comprazer, nem rem\u00e9dio mortal nem um conselho que induza a perda. Do mesmo modo n\u00e3o darei a nenhuma mulher uma subst\u00e2ncia abortiva. Conservarei imaculada minha vida e minha arte.</p> <p>N\u00e3o praticarei a talha, mesmo sobre um calculoso confirmado; deixarei essa opera\u00e7\u00e3o aos pr\u00e1ticos que disso cuidam.</p> <p>Em toda a casa, a\u00ed entrarei para o bem dos doentes, mantendo-me longe de todo o dano volunt\u00e1rio e de toda a sedu\u00e7\u00e3o sobretudo longe dos prazeres do amor, com as mulheres ou com os homens livres ou escravizados.</p> <p>\u00c0quilo que no exerc\u00edcio ou fora do exerc\u00edcio da profiss\u00e3o e no conv\u00edvio da sociedade, eu tiver visto ou ouvido, que n\u00e3o seja preciso divulgar, eu conservarei inteiramente secreto.</p> <p>Se eu cumprir este juramento com fidelidade, que me seja dado gozar felizmente da vida e da minha profiss\u00e3o, honrado para sempre entre os homens; se eu dele me afastar ou infringir, o contr\u00e1rio aconte\u00e7a.</p> levantar fonte. <p>Este juramento tem seus m\u00e9ritos mas \u00e9 rid\u00edculo em alguns pontos, como bem apontado por Dr\u00e1uzio Varella. A vers\u00e3o seguinte, mais recente, faz mais sentido.</p> <p>Juramento de Hip\u00f3crates</p> <p>Prometo que, ao exercer a arte de curar, mostrar-me-ei sempre fiel aos preceitos da honestidade, da caridade e da ci\u00eancia.</p> <p>Penetrando no interior dos lares, meus olhos ser\u00e3o cegos, minha l\u00edngua calar\u00e1 os segredos que me forem revelados, o que terei como preceito de honra.</p> <p>Nunca me servirei da minha profiss\u00e3o para corromper os costumes ou favorecer o crime.</p> <p>Se eu cumprir este juramento com fidelidade, goze eu para sempre a minha vida e a minha arte com boa reputa\u00e7\u00e3o entre os homens; se o infringir ou dele afastar-me, suceda-me o contr\u00e1rio.</p> levantar fonte. <p>Ainda assim \u00e9 estranho fazer um juramento para fazer seu trabalho corretamente. Imagine-se jurando que minimizar\u00e1 bugs no seu c\u00f3digo e n\u00e3o acessar\u00e1 dados indevidamente. N\u00e3o, o juramento de Hip\u00f3crates \u00e9 mais para <sub>ingl\u00eas</sub> os pais verem que para servir como c\u00f3digo de \u00e9tica. O verdadeiro c\u00f3digo de \u00e9tica da Medicina no Brasil \u00e9 estabelecido pelo conselho federal de medicina e \u00e9 bem mais extenso.</p>"},{"location":"teaching/gsi009/#etica-na-computacao","title":"\u00c9tica na Computa\u00e7\u00e3o","text":"<p>J\u00e1 na computa\u00e7\u00e3o, como fica a quest\u00e3o da \u00e9tica profissional?</p> <p>N\u00e3o h\u00e1, no Brazil, um c\u00f3digo de \u00e9tica estabelecido pelo Conselho Federal dos Computeiros, at\u00e9 por qu\u00ea n\u00e3o h\u00e1 um reconhecimento dos \"computeiros\" como uma classe profissional como \u00e9 o caso de outras profiss\u00f5es.

Assim, \u00e9 importante pensar sobre como nossas atua\u00e7\u00f5es como \"computeiros\" impactam a sociedade ao nosso redor, a despeito da sociedade entender o que fazemos ou n\u00e3o</p> <p></p> <p>Para dar alguns exemplos simples e bem pr\u00f3ximos, pensemos na quantidade de dados pessoais que as redes sociais acumulam. Voc\u00ea, ao criar sua conta do Facebook ou Instagram, leu os termos de servi\u00e7o? Sabe quais dados podem ser gravados e com quem podem ser compartilhados? A frase seguinte descreve bem a situa\u00e7\u00e3o:</p> <p>Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o est\u00e1 pagando pelo produto, ent\u00e3o o produto \u00e9 voc\u00ea!</p> <p>Em praticamente todos os servi\u00e7os de redes sociais, todas as sua intera\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o gravadas e usadas para montar seu perfil, que ser\u00e1 colocado em grupos usados para direcionar an\u00fancios e campanhas. Por mais que voc\u00ea possa se achar especial, saiba que somos muito, muito previs\u00edveis e que podemos ser facilmente manipulados. Para ver um grande exemplo disso, pense nas campanhas pol\u00edticas de 2016 nos estados unidos e 2018 no Brasil. Milhares de mensagens direcionadas os eleitores indecisos serviram para virar a balan\u00e7a para um lado ou para outro, como \u00e9 muito bem documentado em \"Big Hack\", dispon\u00edvel no Netflix.</p> <p>Mas para al\u00e9m dos perfis das redes sociais, a tecnologia poder\u00e1 afetar nossa vida de outras formas tamb\u00e9m muito importantes. Ela permite a gera\u00e7\u00e3o e processamento de imagens m\u00e9dicas de forma a melhorar diagn\u00f3sticos, permite cirurgias a longa dist\u00e2ncia, o entretenimento no conforto da sua casa, o relacionamento com outrem, o aumento da efici\u00eancia dos neg\u00f3cios, a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o de transportes, etcetera.</p> <p>Infelizmente, parece que toda tecnologia com potencial para uso ben\u00e9fico \u00e0 sociedade, tamb\u00e9m pode ser usada em seu detrimento. Por exemplo, as IA (Intelig\u00eancias Artificiais) sendo treinadas por dados classificados por humanos, perseverar\u00e3o divis\u00f5es sociais, desigualdades e discrimina\u00e7\u00f5es. Steven Levy discute esta ideia muito bem no artigo We Asked for Flying Cars. We Got Axl Rose's Twitter Spat.</p> <p>Na fic\u00e7\u00e3o, vemos v\u00e1rios exemplos destas reviravoltas. Em espec\u00edfico, o epis\u00f3dio Black Mirror (Season 3): Nosedive fala muito bem sobre como a tecnologia, neste caso em espec\u00edfico as redes sociais que s\u00e3o muito presentes em nossas vidas, tem o potencial de alterar a forma como nos comunicamos, compartilhamos informa\u00e7\u00e3o, e somos classificados em nossa sociedade. Outro exemplo, o filme Minority Report fala sobre como uma tecnologia para a preven\u00e7\u00e3o de crimes pode ser usada para cercear a liberdade das pessoas.</p> <p>Apesar do futurismo do v\u00eddeos, situa\u00e7\u00f5es exatamente como estas j\u00e1 est\u00e3o acontecendo, como se pode ver em</p> <ul> <li>Facial recognition, data harvesting and the end of privacy</li> <li>Facing Up to Facial Recognition</li> <li> </li> <li>Police Unlock AI's Potential to Monitor, Surveil and Solve Crimes</li> </ul> <p>Embora o reconhecimento facial receba grande parte da aten\u00e7\u00e3o , h\u00e1 v\u00e1rios outros exemplos de tecnologia sendo usada em detrimento da sociedade, n\u00e3o por erro do julgamento, mas por direta a\u00e7\u00e3o de engenheiros, administradores e desenvolvedores de software, \u00e9 o caso da Volkswagen, documentado no Epis\u00f3dio 1, Temporada 1, de Dirty Money, no Netflix.  Fontes sobre o mesmo assunto abundam, por exemplo </p> <ul> <li>Volkswagen emissions scandal</li> </ul> <p>Felizmente, h\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m rea\u00e7\u00f5es dos seus colegas de profiss\u00e3o, como visto na iniciativa Ethical OS, do Center for Humane Technology.</p> <ul> <li>O que voc\u00eas acharam dos v\u00eddeos que falam sobre pr\u00e9-crime, ou o uso de IA para identificar crimes antes de acontecerem?</li> <li>Como fica a quest\u00e3o da privacidade?</li> <li>O pr\u00e9-julgamento pode afetar o resultado, levando a profecias auto-realizadoras?</li> <li>Como previnir que tecnologias sejam mal utilizadas?</li> </ul> <p>Quanto mais a IA se desenvolve, maior \u00e9 seu potencial para nos auxiliar na tomada de decis\u00f5es em nossas vidas.</p> <ul> <li>Qual a melhor vacina para COVID-19? </li> <li>\u00c9 melhor o carro se desligar neste sem\u00e1foro e religar quando abrir ou manter o motor funcionando?</li> <li>Qual a melhor rota de entrega de encomendas?</li> </ul> <p>Dentre as respostas para estas perguntas, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel identificar aquela que \u00e9 melhor. Para a segunda, por exemplo, se a IA mandar desligar o motor para apenas um segundo depois eu ter que religar o carro, ent\u00e3o a resposta n\u00e3o foi boa e deve ser penalizada. Algumas perguntas, entretanto, s\u00e3o mais subjetivas.</p> <ul> <li>O comportamento desta pessoa, no parque, a meia-noite, \u00e9 suspeito?</li> <li>Qual o melhor candidato para esta vaga de emprego? </li> <li>Qual o melhor artigo para oferecer para leitura a este usu\u00e1rio?</li> </ul> <p>E nesta subjetividade, os vi\u00e9ses dos humanos s\u00e3o reproduzidos nas m\u00e1quinas. No seu feed do Facebook por exemplo, voc\u00ea deve receber muito mais not\u00edcias sobre as viagens de seus colegas que de recalls de BMW. Isso acontece porqu\u00ea o Facebook lhe oferece artigos que casam com seus interesses, levantados por anos de intera\u00e7\u00e3o com o sistema. Acontece que esta abordagem refor\u00e7a seus interesses e lhe mantem \u00e9 uma bolha. H\u00e1 v\u00e1rios casos documentados de vi\u00e9s no mundo da IA. </p> <p> </p> <p>O problema principal aqui \u00e9 que nossos vi\u00e9ses s\u00e3o reproduzidos sem nos darmos conta, e estes vi\u00e9ses poderiam ser a raz\u00e3o da nossa destrui\u00e7\u00e3o. Se voc\u00ea nunca se preocupou com destruir formigas, seres inferiores a voc\u00ea, por qu\u00ea uma IA deveria se importar com voc\u00ea, se lhe julgar inferior?</p> <p> </p> <p>E alguns certamente acham que seremos inferiores em algum momento.</p> <p></p> <p>Eles certamente j\u00e1 jogam M\u00e1rio melhor que eu.</p> <p>Para previnir este desastre, isto \u00e9, que elas se tornem superiores, n\u00e3o que elas joguem M\u00e1rio melhor que n\u00f3s, alguns advogam que limitemos o poder das IA.</p> <p></p> <p>O que voc\u00ea acha?  </p> <p>Mesmo se limitarmos o poder de decis\u00e3o da AI em nossas vidas, algumas situa\u00e7\u00f5es certamente vir\u00e3o em um futuro pr\u00f3ximo. Por exemplo, vejamos alguns dos dilemas que ve\u00edculos auto dirig\u00edveis enfrentar\u00e3o.</p> <p></p> <p>Como n\u00f3s, como desenvolvedores podemos ajudar, ou pelo menos n\u00e3o piorar, o futuro da humanidade?</p> <p>E se sobrar tempo, aprendam sobre HAL, no filme 2001 - Uma odiss\u00e9ia no espa\u00e7o.</p>"},{"location":"teaching/gsi009/#semana-4","title":"Semana 4","text":"<p>H\u00e1 v\u00e1rias possibilidades de atua\u00e7\u00e3o para os graduados nas \u00e1reas de computa\u00e7\u00e3o.  \u00c9 poss\u00edvel empreender, isto \u00e9, montar sua pr\u00f3pria empresa e atacar algum problema ou, como dizem os profissionais do ramo, uma dor de um cliente.
